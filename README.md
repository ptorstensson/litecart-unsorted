# litecart-unsorted
Unsorted development backups for personal use mainly, since I won't put to much time trying to explain for others about these bits'n'pieces. This is my attempt to get to know the inner workings of [LiteCart](http:/litecart.net/)  
Work in progress, and once a mod/plugin is more or less finished, that specific 'package' will get it's own repository. Something like 'litecart-vqmod-productImageFilename'.. So nothing here is static so to say.  
The code I'm chopButching is LiteCart v-1.3.3.1, I have not yet upgraded to v-1.3.4 (Jan 2016)

## Repository content
* [./cartae/DiagramDesigner-flowChartishMockup-v2.ddd](../blob/master/cartae/DiagramDesigner-flowChartishMockup-v2.ddd)
  If you try to decipher this one, remember that it is very generalized. Some things left out for the simplicity, and other are not yet finished.
* [./cartae/An_index_call-Templatish.md](../blob/master/cartae/An_index_call-Templatish.md)
  Whats happening during an call to shop-root, no params. What functions'n'classes are used, what vars are set and so on. Sort of LOC-snippets of interest just to grasp the flow.
